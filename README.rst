Make GTFS
***********
.. image:: https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfs_kit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg

A Python 3.10+ library to build GTFS feeds from basic route information.
Inspired by Conveyal's `geom2gtfs <https://github.com/conveyal/geom2gtfs>`_.
Makes naive timetables, but they are often good enough for preliminary work.

Installation
=============
Here are instructions if you're using UV for Python dependency management.
To use as a library in your own project, install as a dependency via  ``uv add make_gtfs``.
To develop the ``make_gtfs`` repo, Git clone it, then run ``uv add make_gtfs``.

If you're using Poetry or another dependency management program then change the UV commands above accordingly.

Usage
=====
Use as a library, or use from the command line by typing ``uv run make_gtfs --help`` and following the instructions.
If you're using Poetry or another dependency management program then change the UV command above accordingly.

Make GTFS uses the following files to build a GTFS feed.


- ``meta.csv`` (required). A CSV file containing network metadata.
  The CSV file contains the following columns.

  - ``agency_name`` (required): string; the name of the transport
    agency
  - ``agency_url`` (required): string; a fully qualified URL for
    the transport agency
  - ``agency_timezone`` (required): string; timezone where the
    transit agency is located; timezone names never contain the
    space character but may contain an underscore; refer to
    `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones>`_ for a list of valid values
  - ``start_date``, ``end_date`` (required): strings; the start
    and end dates for which all this network information is valid
    formated as YYYYMMDD strings

- ``shapes.geojson`` (required). A GeoJSON file containing route shapes.
  The file comprises one feature collection of LineString features, where each feature's properties contains at least the attribute ``shape_id``.
  Each LineString should represent the run of one representive trip of a route.
  In particular, the LineString should not traverse the same section of road many times, unless you want a trip to actually do that.

- ``service_windows.csv`` (required). A CSV file containing service window
  information.
  A *service window* is a time interval and a set of days of the
  week during which all routes have constant service frequency,
  e.g. Saturday and Sunday 07:00 to 09:00.
  The CSV file contains the following columns.

  - ``service_window_id`` (required): string; a unique identifier
    for a service window
  - ``start_time``, ``end_time`` (required): string; the start
    and end times of the service window in HH:MM:SS format where
    the hour is less than 24
  - ``monday``, ``tuesday``, ``wednesday``, ``thursday``,
    ``friday``, ``saturday``, ``sunday`` (required); 0
    or 1; indicates whether the service is active on the given day
    (1) or not (0)

- ``frequencies.csv`` (required). A CSV file containing route frequency information.
  The CSV file contains the following columns.

  - ``route_short_name`` (required): string; a unique short name
    for the route, e.g. '51X'
  - ``route_long_name`` (required): string; full name of the route
    that is more descriptive than ``route_short_name``
  - ``route_type`` (required): integer; the
    `GTFS type of the route <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#routestxt>`_
  - ``service_window_id`` (required): string; a service window ID
    for the route taken from the file ``service_windows.csv``
  - ``direction`` (required): 0, 1, or 2; indicates
    whether the route travels in the direction of its shape (1), or in the reverse direction of its shape (0), or in both directions (2);
    in the latter case, trips will be created that travel in both
    directions along the route's shape, each direction operating at
    the given frequency;  otherwise, trips will be created that
    travel in only the given direction
  - ``frequency`` (required): integer; the frequency of the route
    during the service window in vehicles per hour.
  - ``shape_id`` (required): string; a shape ID that is listed in
    ``shapes.geojson`` and corresponds to the linestring of the
    (route, direction, service window) tuple
  - ``speed`` (optional): float; the average speed of the route in
    kilometers per hour

  Missing speed values will be filled with values from the library's dictionary
  `SPEED_BY_RTYPE`.

- ``speed_zones.geojson`` (optional). A GeoJSON file of Polygons representing
  speed zones for routes.
  The file consists of one feature collection of Polygon features
  (in WGS84 coordinates), each with the properties

  - ``speed_zone_id`` (required): string; a unique identifier of the zone polygon; can
    be re-used if the polygon is re-used
  - ``route_type`` (required): integer; a GTFS route type to which the zone applies
  - ``speed`` (required): positive float; the average speed in kilometers per hour
    of routes of that route type that travel within the zone; overrides route
    speeds in ``frequencies.csv`` within the zone.

- ``stops.csv`` (optional). A CSV file containing all the required
  and optional fields of ``stops.txt`` in
  `the GTFS <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#stopstxt>`_.



Algorithm
=========
Basically,

- ``routes.txt`` is created from ``frequencies.csv``.
- ``agency.txt`` is created from ``meta.csv``.
- ``calendar.txt`` is created in a dumb way with exactly one all-week service that applies to all trips.
- ``shapes.txt`` is created from ``shapes.geojson``.
- ``stops.txt`` is created from ``stops.csv`` if given.
  Otherwise it is created by making a pair of stops for each shape, one stop at each endpoint of the shape and then deleting stops with duplicate coordinates. Note that this yields only one stop for each shape that is a loop.
- ``trips.txt`` and ``stop_times.txt`` are created by taking each route, service window, and direction, and running a set of trips starting on the hour and operating at the route's speed and frequency specified for that service window.
  If the route direction is 2, then two sets of trips in opposing directions will be created, each operating at the route's frequency.
  Assign stops to each trip as follows.
  Collect all stops in the built file ``stops.txt`` that are within a fixed distance of the traffic side (e.g. the right hand side for USA agency timezones and the left hand side for New Zealand agency timezones) of the trip shape.
  If the trip has no nearby stops, then do not make stop times for that trip.
- Once validated, write these files to disk by running command ``feed.write("gtfsfile.zip")``.

  Probably more instructive for the user that way.
- Fixed `Issue 11 <https://gitlab.com/mrcagney/make_gtfs/-/issues/11>`_.


4.0.4, 2022-10-19
-----------------
- Bugfix: Changed ``make_stop_points`` to correctly respect the ``offset`` parameter.


4.0.3, 2022-10-18
-----------------
- Bugfix: Created proper default speed zones when creating ProtoFeeds without given speed zones.
- Clarified README docs some.


4.0.2, 2022-10-17
-----------------
- Bugfix: Propogated ``stop_offset`` parameter in ``build_feed`` down the function chain.


4.0.1, 2022-10-11
-----------------
- Speeded up ``make_stop_points`` when ``offset`` is zero.


4.0.0, 2022-10-11
-----------------
- Offset built stops to the traffic side of each shape.

3.1.0, 2022-10-06
-----------------
- Extended ``build_stops()`` and ``build_feed()`` to to build a specified number of equally spaced stops on each built shape or to build stops with a specified spacing on each built shape.

  That way we avoid building duplicate stops.

2.1.0, 2019-10-10
-----------------
- Switched to Python 3.6+ and Poetry.

- Simplified the code some too.


0.5.1, 2015-01-28
